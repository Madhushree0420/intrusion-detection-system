# intrusion-detection-system
 

**Technology Stack:**

Layer Tool/Tech Why It Is Used Frontend Streamlit Used to build a simple, fast, interactive web app for real-time intrusion detection without complex frontend coding. Backend Python Main programming language to develop logic, handle model loading, user inputs, and predictions. Backend Scikit-learn Used to apply machine learning algorithms, including model training and prediction (Random Forest here). ML Algorithm RandomForestClassifier A powerful, ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to classify data accurately as attack or normal. Explanation SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Used to explain why the model predicted something, by showing which features influenced the output most â€” bringing trust to AI. Visualization Matplotlib Basic plotting library used to create graphs and charts for feature importance, SHAP values, etc. Visualization Seaborn Built on Matplotlib; makes the plots more beautiful, colorful, and easier to read for quick insights. File Handling Pandas Used to load, clean, and manipulate datasets (like NSL-KDD) and manage input/output data easily in DataFrames. File Handling joblib Used to save (serialize) and load the trained machine learning model files quickly without retraining every time.
